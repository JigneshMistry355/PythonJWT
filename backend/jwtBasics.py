# Here are the top three important drawbacks of JWT:

# 1. Stateless Nature: While JWTâ€™s statelessness is a plus, it can also be a drawback. Revoking tokens (e.g., when a user logs out or change password) can be challenging since JWTs are self-contained.

# 2. Security Risks with Stored Tokens: Storing JWTs on the client side can pose security risks if they are compromised.

# 3. Token Size: JWT tokens can grow in size if you include a lot of information in the payload, potentially increasing bandwidth usage.
